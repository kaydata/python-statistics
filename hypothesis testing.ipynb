    "### Basics of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis( H~0~ ) :The null hypothesis assumes no effect or difference in the population. It serves as the default assumption that we try to reject.\n",
    "- Alternate Hypothesis (Ha or H1): This is what you want to prove --That there is an effect or a difference\n",
    "- Significance Level (α): The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Common choises are 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1\n",
    "- Test Statistic: This is a measure calculated from the sample data that is used to assess the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- P-value : The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated, assuming that the null hypothesis is true\n",

    "### Steps in Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "1. State the Hypotheses: Null and hypothesis\n",

    "4. Calculate the Test Statistic and P-value\n",
